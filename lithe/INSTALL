Lithe currently only builds static libraries (liblithe.a). Also, Lithe
needs to be built using a special GCC thread-local storage model (see
src/Makefile.in).

Example building Lithe in 'build' directory:

$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ ../configure --prefix=<installation directory>
...
$ make
...
$ make install
...


Please send questions and any other feedback to lithe@lists.eecs.berkeley.edu.
